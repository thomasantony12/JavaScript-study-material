          <p>
            Variables and data types are foundational concepts in programming,
            serving as the building blocks for storing and manipulating
            information within a program. In JavaScript, understanding these
            concepts is essential for writing effective and efficient code.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><p>Cannot be a keyword. (eg: var, cons, console, log)</p></li>
            <li><p>Should be meaning full.</p></li>
            <li><p>Cannot start with a number. (eg: 1name)</p></li>
            <li>
              <p>Cannot contain space or hyphen. (eg: car-name or car name)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                variables are used to store and manage data. They are created
                using the <b>var, let, or const</b> keyword.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Uses <b>camel case</b> notations. (eg: firstName, secondName)
              </p>
            </li>
            <li><p>JavaSceript is case sensitive.</p></li>

                <code>
                  let firstName = 'Thomas';
                  var lastName = 'Antony';
                  let ph_number = 9645611774;
                  const age = 10;

          <h1>Types of variable (Data Types)</h1>
          <h3>Primitive or Value Data Types</h3>
          <p>
            The predefined data types provided by JavaScript language are known
            as primitive data types. Primitive data types are also known as
            in-built data types.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                <b>Number:</b> JavaScript numbers are always stored in
                double-precision 64-bit binary format IEEE 754. Unlike other
                programming languages, you don’t need int, float, etc to declare
                different numeric values.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <b>String:</b> JavaScript Strings are similar to sentences. They
                are made up of a list of characters, which is essentially just
                an “array of characters, like “Hello GeeksforGeeks” etc.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <b>Boolean:</b> Represent a logical entity and can have two
                values: true or false.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><b>Null:</b> This type has only one value that is null.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <b>Undefined:</b> A variable that has not been assigned a value
                is undefined.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <b>Symbol:</b> Symbols return unique identifiers that can be
                used to add unique property keys to an object that won’t collide
                with keys of any other code that might add to the object.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <b>BigInt:</b> BigInt is a built-in object in JavaScript that
                provides a way to represent whole numbers larger than 2^53-1.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Non-Primitive Data Types</h3>
          <p>
            The data types that are derived from primitive data types of the
            JavaScript language are known as non-primitive data types. It is
            also known as derived data types or reference data types.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                <b>Object:</b> It is the most important data type and forms the
                building blocks for modern JavaScript. We will learn about these
                data types in detail in further articles.
